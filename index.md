# Sathvik Rajasekaran
### _About Me_
My name is Sathvik and I am a senior at [Lynbrook High School](https://lhs.fuhsd.org).

### _Projects_
#### Nutrition Project
When one of my family members was diagnosed with tree nut allergies, I recognized the prevalence and lack of treatment options. I began to develop an app in which users can enter meals that they ate and any symptoms they had. The app breaks the food down into ingredients and over time tries to figure out what ingredient had caused the symptoms using both statistical analysis and machine learning. Based on these factors, it makes predictions about what the user may be allergic to, that way, they can avoid eating foods with those ingredients, preventing potentially life threatening situations. I have learned the following skills and been I’m very proud of having this in my portfolio:
- Machine Learning
- Java, Python
- Weka



### _A Little More About Me_
